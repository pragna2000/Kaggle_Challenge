# Kaggle_Challenge
- This repository is an attempt to solve the Kaggle Competition 'House Prices'. The challenge was to use any regression model to prodict house prices in Ames, Iowa using 79 vairables like zoning, lot size, the type of neighborhood, condition the house was in, etc. In this notebook, there are three regression models that predict the prices of the houses based on the given information.
